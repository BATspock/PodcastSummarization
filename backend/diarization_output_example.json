Like, but I say things to my kids like, listen, if you enjoy study and work, both things that I very much enjoy, I do for fun, your life is going to feel great and it's going to feel easy. So some of those old-fashioned virtues of things I try to preach, counterintuitive stuff like outdoor time, playing, having time that are not intermediate experiences is really important. And little things, like I talk about on the book about when my kids are watching something that's scary. And I'm not talking about like zombie movies, you know, I'm talking about like a cartoon that has kind of a scary moment. And saying that they want to turn the TV off and I talk to them and I say, listen, I'm going to sit next to you and we're going to finish this show. And I want you to tell me what you think of this afterwards. And I sat next to my sons and by the end of it every single time. I, you know, when I asked them, was that as scary as you thought it was going to be? And there was like no daddy, that was fine. And I'm like, that's one of the great lessons in life. The fear that you don't go through becomes much bigger in your head than actually simply facing it. That's one of the reasons I'm finding back against this culture. I love, you know, for all of our kids to be able to grow up in an environment where people give you grace and, you know, accept the fact that sometimes people are going to say things that piss you off, take seriously the possibility of it to be wrong and and be curious."
