[Speaker:0] There is sort of an eerie parallel,
[Speaker:0] and you have to be extremely careful, drawing such parallels and such
[Speaker:0] connections to this
[Speaker:0] unacceptable
[Speaker:0] war in war that is World war two.
[Speaker:0] But
[Speaker:0] is there elements
[Speaker:0] of this that do echo in the actions of vladimir Putin
[Speaker:0] and more specifically,
[Speaker:0] Do you think the vladimir putin is a war criminal?
[Speaker:0] Can that label be assigned to the actions of this man?
[Speaker:1] So war criminal
[Speaker:1] is a legal
[Speaker:1] determination, and it requires evidence and do process
[Speaker:1] of the ability to defend oneself
[Speaker:1] We don't just decide
[Speaker:1] in the Twitter sphere
[Speaker:1] or on a podcast that somebody is a war criminal.
[Speaker:1] They can be a suspected war criminal,
[Speaker:1] and we can gather evidence
[Speaker:1] to try to prosecute that case.
[Speaker:1] And then the issue for us lexus.
[Speaker:1] Which court does it go to?
[Speaker:1] What's the appropriate place?
[Speaker:1] Does it happen in Ukraine because they're are the victims? Does it happen in the hog because there's an international criminal court there?
[Speaker:1] Does it happen inside Russia because there's regime change at some point.
[Speaker:1] And some of these people
[Speaker:1] become
[Speaker:1] let's say they get arrested by their own
[Speaker:1] people inside Russia.
[Speaker:1] So those are all important questions.
[Speaker:1] That have to be pursued with resources and with
[Speaker:1] determination and
[Speaker:1] and by skilled people who are
[Speaker:1] excellent gathering that evidence. And that process is underway. And Ukraine has a trial underway now
[Speaker:1] of one.
[Speaker:1] Alleged war criminal,
[Speaker:1] who's pleaded guilty and we'll see what the
[Speaker:1] outcome of that trial inside Ukraine is of a lower level official, not obviously.
[Speaker:1] Vladimir putin, but the commander of a tank group.
[Speaker:1] So
[Speaker:1] yes,
[Speaker:1] The names are ee familiar.
[Speaker:1] I zoom,
[Speaker:1] har,
[Speaker:1] give.
[Speaker:1] Right? Those are the names we know
[Speaker:1] from the Nazi invasion and the Nazi
[Speaker:1] occupation. Of Ukraine.
[Speaker:1] And it's
[Speaker:1] very deeply troubling
[Speaker:1] to think that this could happen again
[Speaker:1] and there's a bizarre sense
[Speaker:1] that the Russians,
[Speaker:1] claiming as Putin says to den
[Speaker:1] Ukraine.
[Speaker:1] Have invaded the same places that the nazis invaded
[Speaker:0] back in nineteen forty one. As somebody who's is working on volume three,
[Speaker:0] of your work on Stalin going through this period,
[Speaker:1] is it eerie to you? Yes. It is like that you're...
[Speaker:1] I've written the chapters of volume three. I've drafted the chapters on the war.
[Speaker:1] And and as I said, the place names are very evo, unfortunately.
[Speaker:1] But but, you know,
[Speaker:1] the Nazis failed ultimately.
[Speaker:1] They
[Speaker:1] captured Ukraine
[Speaker:1] for a time,
[Speaker:1] but they were evicted
[Speaker:1] from Ukraine.
[Speaker:1] And there was massive
[Speaker:1] partisan
[Speaker:1] or guerrilla warfare resistance behind nazi lines, the whole time.
[Speaker:1] That they were
[Speaker:1] allegedly in control of Ukraine.
[Speaker:1] If you look at the maps on cable Tv, they show you the sign of rush they show you the coloring, Russian control, and they draw a line and then it's colored in.
[Speaker:1] But the word control is misplaced.
[Speaker:1] They don't actually control it. It's Russian claimed or
[Speaker:1] or extent the farthest
[Speaker:1] Russian
[Speaker:1] troop advancement.
[Speaker:1] Because behind the Russian lines in Ukraine, Crimea accepted,
[Speaker:1] you have en, you have armed inc.
[Speaker:1] And Mill top, for example,
[Speaker:1] which is a place that you know
[Speaker:1] in Southeastern
[Speaker:1] Ukraine.
[Speaker:1] There is a Gorilla war now underway
[Speaker:1] to
[Speaker:1] hurt the Russians
[Speaker:1] who are in occupation of that city and region.
[Speaker:1] And we're gonna see that continue.
[Speaker:1] Even if
[Speaker:1] the war becomes a stalemate
[Speaker:1] even if it stalemate more or less that the lines were at now,
[Speaker:1] which would mean
[Speaker:1] that
[Speaker:1] anticipated Ukrainian counter offensive its scale proves unsuccessful.
[Speaker:1] The Russian army doesn't disintegrate
[Speaker:1] and you end up with
[Speaker:1] a stalemate where there could be a cease ceasefire or not a cease ceasefire, but neither side is attempting an offensive for the time being
[Speaker:1] There will be resistance
[Speaker:1] behind those Russian lines,
[Speaker:1] and it will be fierce resistance.
[Speaker:1] The kind of resistance we saw to the Nazi.
[Speaker:1] Ultimately, it took the Red army
[Speaker:1] re invading
[Speaker:1] the territory
[Speaker:1] of Ukraine and succeeding
[Speaker:1] at combined
[Speaker:1] arms operations at scale, a mass of counter offensive much larger than anything we're talking about today.
[Speaker:1] Ultimately, it required that to e the nazis from Ukraine.
[Speaker:1] But in the meantime, they did not have an easy
[Speaker:1] occupation regime there.
[Speaker:1] Ukrainian
[Speaker:1] partisan
[Speaker:1] Soviet partisan,
[Speaker:1] killed,
[Speaker:1] nazi officials, Wehrmacht, soldiers, Wehrmacht, officers blew up
[Speaker:1] the infrastructure they were using
[Speaker:1] made them pay a price for their occupation.
[Speaker:1] We could well see
[Speaker:1] if unfortunately, this ends in a stalemate for the time being,
[Speaker:1] we could well see that type of uncertainty
[Speaker:1] gain momentum behind Russian lines
[Speaker:1] and try to e the Russians that way
[Speaker:1] and then rem mount the counter offensive its scale later on in the future, if the first one doesn't succeed.
[Speaker:1] So that would be further
[Speaker:1] echoes
[Speaker:1] of the World war two experience. The scale once again is much smaller.
[Speaker:1] The size of the armies here,
[Speaker:1] they're not in the many...
[Speaker:1] Eight hundred thousand seven hundred thousand a million two a million four. That's not what we're talking about today.
[Speaker:1] But the weapons,
[Speaker:1] the cruise missiles,
[Speaker:1] right?
[Speaker:1] Artillery fire
[Speaker:1] You know, artillery fire used to be very inaccurate, and it was like saturation. Mh. You were just fire towards the enemy lines and if you hit something, you hit something and you didn't. You just kept firing.
[Speaker:1] Now you have drones
[Speaker:1] legs.
[Speaker:1] And so artillery fire is now sniper fire.
[Speaker:1] Because you can coordinate the direction of the artillery fire with the drones.
[Speaker:1] The drones can take a picture and show you where the enemy is precisely located.
[Speaker:1] And you can align that artillery to hit them instead of just ind
[Speaker:1] bombing an area
[Speaker:1] a territory.
[Speaker:1] And the nato supplied artillery
[Speaker:1] goes really far,
[Speaker:1] and you can fire into Russian positions
[Speaker:1] and yourself not be exposed to Russian fire
[Speaker:1] because your
[Speaker:1] artillery
[Speaker:1] fires father,
[Speaker:1] than theirs.
[Speaker:1] So that's coming.
[Speaker:1] And we're gonna see that in action.
[Speaker:1] And so
[Speaker:1] the scale is not the same, but the weapons the precision of some of the weapons and some of the needle. And we're not sending all of our stuff.
[Speaker:1] But as I said, the dynamic is Russia commits atrocities, Russia bombs schools, Russia bombs, hospitals, Russia kill civilians
[Speaker:1] and more
[Speaker:1] and heavier
[Speaker:1] and more lethal.
[Speaker:1] Western weapons go to Ukraine. Their willingness to risk their lives
[Speaker:1] is really so impressive and the reason
[Speaker:1] that we... It's
[Speaker:1] It's our duty.
[Speaker:1] We're obliged to supply those weapons. And so the Russians don't have that res resupply and the Ukrainians do.
[Speaker:1] And so the Russians are now digging le.
[Speaker:1] They're digging in deeply in the areas that they've penetrated.
[Speaker:1] And they're trying to build una sal
[Speaker:1] positions
[Speaker:1] went for when the Ukrainians
[Speaker:1] transition.
[Speaker:1] From mostly defense to full scale offense.
[Speaker:1] And we'll see if that now... I mean, they're digging
[Speaker:1] everywhere.
[Speaker:1] You know, as they say,
[Speaker:1] compiled.
[Speaker:1] Compiled. Right? They're digging everywhere behind. Your Russian is beautiful. Digging in, I wish le like years.
[Speaker:1] But so so there are these things that we can't predict, but there are these things we're watching and watching closely.
[Speaker:0] And on top of that, something that's not in World war two or for the most part is cyber attacks and cyber warfare, which
[Speaker:0] is
[Speaker:0] much less perhaps
[Speaker:0] convertible into human words. Because it happens so quickly it's large scales. So difficult to trace and all those kinds of things. It's not bullets. It's
[Speaker:1] electrical signals in the that. Yeah. But those Ukrainian people, they're like Ul ux.
[Speaker:1] They're young,
[Speaker:1] and they're technically really proficient.
[Speaker:1] Yes. And they've been amazing.
[Speaker:1] You know, they spent those teenage years in the basement. Yeah. Playing video games.
[Speaker:1] Not turns out. It's useful after all. It turns out it's more than useful. You can save your country that way.
[Speaker:1] And so they're not alone, they're getting support,
[Speaker:1] and that support is important.
[Speaker:1] But really,
[Speaker:1] predominantly, it's Ukrainians on the cyber battlefield,
[Speaker:1] And their skills have been very impressive and they've been preparing for this for a number of years.
[Speaker:1] And they have a whole army.
[Speaker:1] Of young people
[Speaker:1] on the cyber side.
[Speaker:1] It's their civilian
[Speaker:1] population. These are not people cons sc into the military or volunteering
[Speaker:1] wearing the uniform.
[Speaker:1] And so even in cyber warfare, the Ukrainians have been extremely impressive.
[Speaker:1] And so let's remember
[Speaker:1] that all of these aspects
[Speaker:1] of warfare
[Speaker:1] whether it's
[Speaker:1] how far your cruise missiles go and how accurate they are.
[Speaker:1] What size your cyber
[Speaker:1] capabilities are and
[Speaker:1] it's really ultimately about the people. It's about the human capital.
[Speaker:1] Right? It's it's about
[Speaker:1] the their willingness
[Speaker:1] their skill level but also their willingness to fight and to put their lives on the line. And and there's no substitute for that. And so what's called morale
[Speaker:1] or courage or bravery or valor?
[Speaker:1] That's really the ultimately
[Speaker:1] decisive
[Speaker:1] provided you have enough
[Speaker:1] sufficient arms,
[Speaker:1] right? To to conduct the fight. And if you don't, you use a molotov of cocktail,
[Speaker:1] Right? Grandma calls in the coordinates of the Russian tank
[Speaker:1] on her iphone
[Speaker:1] and you
[Speaker:1] have a molotov of cocktail
[Speaker:1] that
[Speaker:1] the the people who used to work in the cafeteria
[Speaker:1] are now stuffing fl liquid into bottles.
[Speaker:1] And you carry one right up to the tank and you smash it against the tanker, you drop it in.
[Speaker:1] One of the hatch in the tank. Right?
[Speaker:1] That there's no substitute to do for that kind of stuff that that level of resolve
[Speaker:1] willingness to die for your country. That's a really big lesson
[Speaker:1] that we need to absorb in our own country.
[Speaker:1] We've been going to war
[Speaker:1] more frequently than we should. And like you said without the justification all the time. And then like henry kissing said,
[Speaker:1] Without understanding how this was gonna end.
[Speaker:1] It's easy to start a war, it's very difficult to win a war, prevail an war, end a war on terms that that meet your original
[Speaker:1] expectations. Right?
[Speaker:1] We've been fighting wars, but we haven't been fighting wars as as societies.
[Speaker:1] We've been fighting wars as a small sliver of our
[Speaker:1] population.
[Speaker:1] Something like one percent of our population is involved with the military because we have an all volunteer force.
[Speaker:1] And that means that it's easier for our politicians to go to war,
[Speaker:1] because they don't face
[Speaker:1] conscription.
[Speaker:1] They don't they don't have the draft,
[Speaker:1] which affects every family in the country.
[Speaker:1] And because
[Speaker:1] the number of people in the volunteer force is such a narrow
[Speaker:1] strat of the population. And so they've been getting away with this
[Speaker:1] because the professional army is much better than the cons army.
[Speaker:1] And an all volunteer force is much preferable from a military point of view.
[Speaker:1] But from a societal point of view.
[Speaker:1] It enables you to go to war too easily
[Speaker:1] as a politician,
[Speaker:1] and it doesn't engage the society the same way that the Ukrainian society is completely engaged
[Speaker:1] from those young hackers
[Speaker:1] all the way up to those grandmothers.
